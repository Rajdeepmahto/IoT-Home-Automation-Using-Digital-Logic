# IoT-Based Home Automation System Using Digital Logic

## Introduction  
This project demonstrates an IoT-based home automation system using Arduino and WiFi modules to control appliances based on real-time sensor data like temperature, humidity, motion, and ambient light.

---

## Objective  
To automate home lighting based on motion detection and light intensity, and monitor environmental parameters using IoT.

---

## Components Used  
- ESP32 / NodeMCU  
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor  
- PIR Motion Sensor  
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)  
- Relay Module  
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires  
- WiFi Network

## Working  
- **PIR Sensor** detects motion.  
- **LDR** measures light intensity.  
- **Relay Module** controls the connected light.  
- **DHT11** measures temperature and humidity.  
- ESP32 hosts a web server to display real-time sensor readings on a web page.

If motion is detected and light level is below a threshold, the system turns on the light automatically via the relay.
